## 📌 Project Description
A Python command-line AI Voice Assistant that interacts with users using speech input/output and a **dark mystery-themed conversational personality**. Built to demonstrate **Voice I/O, automation, functions, loops, conditionals, and randomized responses**.

---

## 🛠 Libraries Used
- `speech_recognition`
- `pyttsx3`
- `random` (standard Python library)

---

## ▶️ How to Run Without Errors

### ✅ Recommended Environment
- Local System Terminal
- VS Code, PyCharm, or any Python IDE with **microphone access**

### Steps
1. Open your system terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell)
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition
   pip install pyttsx3
   pip install pyaudio


Run the Python script:

python voice_assistant.py

## ❌ Not Supported

Most online Python compilers because they don’t allow:

Installing pyaudio

Accessing microphone hardware

Running speech processing features

## sample output
Listening...
You said: hello
Bot: Greetings! Tell me what you need.

Listening...
You said: what is your name
Bot: Names hold power. But you may call me *Mistfall Whisper*.

Listening...

Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day ahead.

🎙 Mistfall Whisper Activated!
The fog curls at your feet. The microphone hums like a recorder in a locked evidence room.
Speak carefully... every word becomes a clue.
(Type or say 'bye' to exit the mist)
